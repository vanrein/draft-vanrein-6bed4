<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Several tunnels for IPv6 have been proposed <a href="#RFC7059" class="xref">[RFC7059]</a>; the novelty of 6bed4 is that it allows the assumption that IPv6 is everywhere; not only can it be implemented for hosts or networks, but even inside an application.  As a result, application developers can rely on transparant IPv6 addressing, even when their code is distributed over a network that may include IPv4-only users.  Currently unsupported use cases such as SIP/RTP, direct file transfer and other peer-to-peer protocols can benefit from the relative simplicity of this model and the knowledge that traffic either transfers directly between peers, or reflects through a relay of the user's choosing.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">To carry IPv6 anywhere, 6bed4 transports it as a UDP payload, contained in UDP/IPv4.  The UDP port and IPv4 address are derived from the IPv6 address on sending, and validated to match upon arrival.  This means that much of the 6bed4 infrastructure can be stateless, like a router.  In addition, IPv4 attackers are still traceable when they use 6bed4 to step up to IPv6.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">The 6bed4 network consists of any number of 6bed4peers running IPv6 applications and usually a 6bed4router that defines a prefix under which it reliably connects peers, and through which it may route to and from native IPv6 addresses.  To optimise routing, one 6bed4peer may choose to access multiple 6bed4routers, but automatic detection of crossover between 6bed4peers under different 6bed4routers is also possible.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">The structure of a 6bed4 address may involve a specialised top half structure in the /64 prefix and/or a specialised bottom half structure following it.  The format of a 6bed4 address with both specialised parts is:</p>
<pre>
|  32 bits |          32         |          50             |  14   |
+----------+---------------------+-------------------------+-------+
|  prefix  | 6bed4router address | direct 6bed4peer address| lanid |
+----------+---------------------+-------------------------+-------+
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">Whether the top half is a 6bed4 address depends on the prefix.  The prefix TBD1::/32 globally defines a 6bed4 address, and supports routing across the Internet.  Prefixes fc64:&lt;netid&gt;::/32 for any &lt;netid&gt; are interpreted as 6bed4 addresses when they occurs on the 6bed4 network, but this interpretation cannot be generally prescribed.  These /32 prefixes permit the interpretation of the top half, where bits 32..64 hold the IPv4 address of a 6bed4router that can further relay the traffic.  Any IPv6 router may pass TBD1::/32 by forward the IPv6 packet over UDP/IPv4 to port TBD2 and the address in the IPv6 top half.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">Any /64 prefix that is a destination address on the 6bed4 network must adhere to this format for the lower half.  These are prefixes announced by 6bed4router and 6bed4peer components, extended to a /114 in a Router Advertisement and having the L and A flags set.  Traffic with a 6bed4peer source address never came from a routed backend, so source addresses arriving over direct peering instead of from a subscribed-to 6bed4router can also be considered to have a 6bed4 lower half.  This lower half contains the IPv4 address and UDP port, as observed by an addressed party.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> <a href="#intro.protocol" id="intro.protocol">Protocol Description</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">The role of a 6bed4router is to be the defining home for one /64 prefix and potentially connect to other IPv6 addresses.  It binds a UDP socket to a static IPv4 address and the standard UDP port TBD2.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">Every 6bed4peer opens a UDP socket and is identified by one or more external pairs of an IPv4 address and UDP port.  The UDP socket is seen as a /64 prefix, usually obtained from a 6bed4router, extended into to as many /114 prefixes as the 6bed4 network has external address/port pairs for its UDP/IPv4 socket.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">When a 6bed4peer desires to run under the /64 prefix of a given 6bed4router, it sends a Router Solicitation to its UDP/IPv4 address.  The response is an initial Router Advertisement that offers a /114 prefix, consisting of the /64 of the 6bed4router externded with the UDP/IPv4 address of the 6bed4peer, as observed by the 6bed4router.  This /114 must be used as the source address in future communications with that 6bed4router.  A 6bed4peer sends Keepalive messages to keep the NAPT mapping towards the 6bed4router open as a reliable bidirectional routing path.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.4">When attempting direct peering, the UDP/IPv4 destination address of a remote 6bed4peer is collected from its /114 and a direct UDP/IPv4 message is attempted.  This may or may not succeed, so the initial attempt is usually a Probe that may result in a future report of a Seen flag.  In reliable modes of operation, the initial traffic is sent through the 6bed4router until it learns that direct peering is possible; more agressive but less reliable peering policies are defined as alternatives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.5">Traffic on the 6bed4 network is validated to hold an IPv6 source address with a lower half mentioning the source UDP/IPv4 address.  Failure to match rejects the message with a corrective Router Advertisement in return.  This allows a 6bed4peer to communicate directly with any 6bed4peer, and to learn of another external UDP/IPv4 address for its UDP socket in relation to other network components.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> <a href="#intro.usecase" id="intro.usecase">Use Cases</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">The 6bed4peer can be run for a network, a machine or even a single application.  It can add IPv6 to any machine that supports IPv4, whether it already supports IPv6 or not.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">The 6bed4router can share a /64 prefix to any number of 6bed4peer nodes.  It may offer additional routes to network regions that can route back to this /64 prefix, including an offering of a default route if the shared prefix is globally routable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.3">Applications may benefit from the certainty that IPv6 is available, especially when they run their own 6bed4 network.  They would normally want to connect to a 6bed4router at its specified IPv4 address and UDP port TBD2 and obtain a /114 prefix holding their own IPv4/UDP address.  The final 14 lanid bits allow a range of addresses to divide as the 6bed4peer sees fit.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.4">Peer-to-peer applications may prefer to evade the 6bed4router and prefer direct peering, at least when both peers are known to use 6bed4 address bottom halves.  This may not always succeed, mostly dependent on NAPT properties which cannot generally be solved.  The desired peering policy can be specified in each frame, and peering success or failure can be learnt from received frames, so preferences among alternative routes could be based on peering properties.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.5">The reliable and desired-direct approaches can be mixed, because the peering policy is separately set in the traffic class for each IPv6 frame.  An application might connect (perhaps with SIP) through a 6bed4router and use a direct-peering data path (perhaps with RTP) afterwards.  It is possible to bind to another address for RTP than for SIP, and the addition of Keepalive messages can even support non-symmetric RTP streams; all this can help to find direct routes where they are possible, and thus rely on a minimum of fallback routing through the 6bed4router.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">Upon arrival of an IPv6 frame over UDP/IPv4, the IPv6 source (and destination) address is verified.  This usually involves testing an IPv6 address to have a lower half containing an IPv4 address and UDP port, almost in network bit order.  The lower half must follow this format:</p>
<pre>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">When a local 6bed4 component intends to connect to a remote 6bed4 component, it may send a Router Solicitation [Section 4.1 of <a href="#RFC4861" class="xref">[RFC4861]</a>] to the IPv4 address and UDP port of the remote.

</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">Every component on the 6bed4 network SHOULD send a Router Advertisement to correct an invalid bottom-half <a href="#_6bed4net.validate" class="xref">Section 3.1</a> in an IPv6 source address.  This allow the sending 6bed4 component to correct its own idea of its externally observed UDP/IPv4 address, at least towards the designated recipient.

<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> <a href="#_6bed4net.prefix" id="_6bed4net.prefix">Network Prefixes</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">The 6bed4 network uses /114 prefixes for its destination addresses.  These addresses contain a UDP/IPv4 address in their bottom half, following a /64 prefix in the address top half.  The top half is considered the identity of a 6bed4 network segment, as ususally defined by a 6bed4router and sometimes by a 6bed4peer.  The top half never changes while processing a corrective Router Advertisement; it does however get assigned by the initial Router Advertisement that follows up on a Router Solicitation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">Even if a 6bed4peer obtains a /64 prefix from a 6bed4router as part of a /114 in an initial Router Advertisement, and even though it is not a router for that address, it may nonetheless use the /64 to construct a /114 towards other 6bed4peers.  This bottom-half logic is a point where 6bed4 destination addresses have more semantics than general IPv6.  Two 6bed4peers may use Router Solicitation and/or Router Advertisements to learn about each other's view on their addresses.  This behaviour is not required for reliable exchanges, but it can help to pierce through more kinds of NAPT router; it is why the /64 is said to describe a 6bed4 network, rather than just the component that introduces it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Typical for IPv6, there is some variation in use cases for different prefix kinds.  We distinguish native prefixes, locally routed prefixes and specific 6bed4 prefixes.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.3.1">3.3.1.</a> <a href="#_6bed4net.prefix.native" id="_6bed4net.prefix.native">Native /64 Prefixes</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.1">Every 6bed4 component can export a native /64 prefix, provided that it can route to it and that the native prefix is routed back to it.  This facility allows sharing that prefix to connecting other components; do note that no access control exists, but the bottom half of an IPv6 address under the prefix reveals the validated UDP/IPv4 address of a source.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.2">The top-half of a native prefix is not recognised as a 6bed4 address, as it is not possible to extract a 6bed4router IPv4 address from it.  As a result, its traffic usually passes over native IPv6 routes.  The benefit of a publicly routable IPv6 address is that it can be used in connections to arbitrary other IPv6 addresses that are also globally routable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.1.p.3">Some hosts have only one /64 available, and may want to mix 6bed4 with services.  Although invalid 6bed4 bottom halves (for instance, UDP port 0) could be allocated for other uses than 6bed4, this is NOT RECOMMENDED because it would break connectivity for other 6bed4 components when the prefix is passed through the 6bed4 network via Router Advertisements.  Instead, the RECOMMENDED procedure would be to setup IPv6 addresses as available to a locally run 6bed4peer on a fixated public IPv4 address and UDP port; the 6bed4 component software may optimise handling for these purposes.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.1">Some IPv6 addresses have been allocated for local routing <a href="#RFC4193" class="xref">[RFC4193]</a>.  The fc00::/7 prefix is divided into administratively assigned fc00::/8 prefixes and randomly completed fd00::/8 prefixes.  With the exception of fc64::/16 discussed below, these addresses are locally routed, also on a 6bed4 network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.2">Local routes cannot be used to communicate with native IPv6 address, unless they happen to be aware of how to return the traffic.  Such native routes in the direct backend of a 6bed4router can be explicitly mentioned in its Router Advertisement, even for a fc00::/7 prefix.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.3">Locally routed addresses can only be communicated with the 6bed4 component that defines them.  Because of this, they MUST NOT be further transmitted through Router Advertisement; connections are 1:1 only.  Whether this is a 6bed4peer to a 6bed4router (reliable) or a 6bed4peer to another 6bed4peer (not reliable) is a matter of application or network configuration.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.4">It is quite possible for a 6bed4peer to setup a random /64 prefix based on fd00::/8, and peers might even form networks between such addresses, possibly based on a distributed hash table.  In such networks, redundancy can be helpful to overcome unreliable direct peering connections.  As explained below, 6bed4 can support the detection of reliability.</p>

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.1">The prefixes fc64::/16 and TBD1::/32 mark what are called 6bed4 prefixes.  The fc64::/16 prefix receives an additional network identifier &lt;netid&gt; to form fc64:&lt;netid&gt;::/32.  These /32 prefixes are used in a top half, whose format is completed with the IPv4 address of a 6bed4router, in network byte order: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.2">The 6bed4router is responsible of knowing its public IPv4 address.  The fixed UDP port on which the 6bed4router provides its service MUST be TBD2.  As a result, a network component that can interpret the prefix as a 6bed4 prefix can route the traffic over the 6bed4 network.  For the TBD1::/32 prefix, this can be any party on the Internet; for fc64::/16 it can only be assumed when the address is found on the 6bed4 network.  The added value of TBD1::/32 over fc64::/16 therefore is that it expands the IPv6-everywhere facilitation of 6bed4 from an overlay network to a globally routed network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.3">The 6bed4router is vital in the reliability of the 6bed4 network: </p>

<ul>
<li>The 6bed4router is always reachable at its IPv4 address and the fixed UDP port TBD2;</li>
<li>The 6bed4router can always reach every 6bed4peer that subscribes to its serviced prefix.</li>
</ul>

<p> This means that a conservative route can always be made through a 6bed4router.  This is also possible when the prefixes differ, either in the IPv4 address or also in the /32 part.  Within the constraints of source address validation, it is possible to route traffic through the 6bed4router covering the source prefix and the 6bed4router covering the destination prefix; or it is possible to route traffic through the 6bed4router of a destination node, after a source 6bed4peer (also) connects to the destination's 6bed4router.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.4">Another value of the 6bed4 prefix is that they represent end points on the 6bed4 network.  This means that the bottom half can also be interpreted and used for direct 6bed4 traffic.  This usually works best when the source address is then also chosen to be a 6bed4 address, which can be achieved under normal address binding rules when a low-priority interface offers routes for fc64::/16 or TBD1::/32 with a prefix under either.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">To be able to route under a 6bed4router's prefix, the 6bed4peer sends a Router Solicitation and awaits an initial Router Advertisement <a href="#_6bed4net.advert" class="xref">Section 3.2</a> to learn about its /114 prefix, which includes the /64 prefix provisioned by the 6bed4router.  The 6bed4peer MAY configure any additional routes provided in a Router Advertisement from a 6bed4router.  Through the Router Advertisement, the 6bed4peer learns about the external address of its UDP socket, as observed by the 6bed4router.

<li>When source and destination share the same /64 prefix, consider direct routing as well as the 6bed4router.</li>
<li>When the destination is a 6bed4 prefix and the source and destination have different /64 prefixes, consider direct routing as well as the 6bed4router.</li>
<li>When the destination has another prefix (that was offered and accepted as a route from a 6bed4router), consider going through the 6bed4router.</li>

When direct routing is selected, any considerations of going through the 6bed4router are dropped.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">When considering the 6bed4router, the /64 prefix of the source address determines which one to use.  When the source and destination have 6bed4 addresses with different /64, the traffic bounces through both 6bed4routers, which is useful to validate the traffic for not forging IPv6 addresses.  To avoid this "trapeziums-shaped" routing, it is also possible for a 6bed4peer to bind an address under the destination address's 6bed4router by sending a Router Solicitation and acquiring a /114 prefix to work from.  The result would be only one 6bed4router bouncing the traffic instead of two.  Whether or not this is done, direct peering may be discovered as reliable alternative and either shape bypassed completely.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">The IPv6 frame can now be sent over the 6bed4 network, from the UDP socket held by the 6bed4peer.  The remote UDP port and IPv4 address are learnt from the bottom half of the destination IPv6 address.  Since a 6bed4peer is not supposed to route traffic, any source address is supposed to be locally bound, therefore be a 6bed4 address, and so its bottom half is supposed to contain the external view on its UDP port and IPv4 address.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">Although it makes less sense for UDP than for TCP, NAPT middleware may have imposed an Endpoint-Dependent Mapping <a href="#RFC4787" class="xref">[RFC4787]</a>, which means that the external UDP port and IPv4 address observed by the 6bed4router form a reasonable initial guess when communicating directly with other 6bed4peers, but there may be a need to correct these aspects when communicating with such 6bed4peers.  To this end, a remote peer might send a corrective Router Advertisement and the IPv6 frame would be lost.  This should not happen when reliability rules are obeyed, but it may happen for frames that select another peering policy than the default.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">Note how this opens degrees of freedom to the an application acting as/via a 6bed4peer.  For general TCP or SCTP, a first SYN or INIT frame might be sent under a peering policy that enforces direct peering, and fall back to reliable routing when resent.  And a application could send SIP messages over reliable patterns, but work towards direct peering for RTP; a SIP/SDP offer can welcome RTP traffic on a 6bed4 address, possibly using a 6bed4router in a SIP/SDP offer that was just received; many SIP networks are closed, and could opt to be IPv6-only networks, with 6bed4 as a reliable fallback option.</p>

This is not routed any further, but it counts as successful input under direct peering.  Usually sent before or after an IPv6 frame via the 6bed4router, it permits flagging that this direct input succeeded on return traffic to that same 6bed4peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">There are two reasons why an IPv6 header's source address might be acceptable; it could be from a 6bed4router to which the receiving 6bed4peer maintains an uplink, or it might be a direct connection from another 6bed4peer under the same 6bed4router.  On top of this, a third reason to accept an IPv6 header is when its source and destination address together indicate that a bypass of a trapezium route is made.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.4">The 6bed4peer should know the 6bed4routers to which it maintains an uplink; it needs this information for sending Keepalives that maintain an open NAPT mapping.

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.5">A frame sent directly from another 6bed4peer working under the same 6bed4router will use a /64 prefix that we got from that 6bed4router.  As a result, we can rely on the bottom half address to contain a IPv4 address and UDP port, which MUST then match the source of the incoming frame.  When the /64 prefix matches but the bottom half does not, a corrective Router Advertisement SHOULD be sent (possibly with a limited frequency).  TODO:REQUIRE_SRC/64_IS_DST/64?</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.6">The bypass for a trapezium route is more complicated.  In this case, the frame came from a 6bed4peer acting under another 6bed4router.  The frame was first passed to the source's 6bed4router and then the destination's.  When the latter delivers the frame at the 6bed4destination, the source and destination IPv6 address are used.  First, both addresses MUST be 6bed4 addresses, so have either the fc64::/16 or TBD1::/32 prefix, in any combination.  Second, the 6bed4router addresses in the top half are considered; the source 6bed4router address is assumed to have been validated by our 6bed4router; the destination 6bed4router address MUST be found as one to which we maintain an uplink.  Third, the source IPv4 address and UDP port MUST be set in the bottom half of the source IPv6 address.  Fourth, our IPv4 address and UDP port according to our 6bed4router (which is mentioned in the top half of the IPv6 destination address) MUST match the bottom half of the IPv6 destination address.  Failure on any of these four conditions leads to discarding of the frame as a suspect frame.</p>

This is done to relay traffic between two 6bed4peers that share the 6bed4router's /64 prefix but that are not (yet) able or willing to connect directly.  It is also done to relay traffic between two 6bed4routers if their 6bed4peers use different /64 prefixes and are not (yet) able or willing to connect directly; this situation is called trapezium routing and is effectively a bypass for routing over IPv6, mostly to permit fc64::/16 prefixes to work across 6bed4routers' prefixes.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Given the nature of NAPT, there can be no completely reliable peering system without a fallback to a services that bounces traffic.  This is why a 6bed4 network needs the fallback option of a 6bed4router to offer reliable routing.  When NAPT is enhanced with port forwarding, this situation can be changed, and some applications may implement so many alternative routing options that full reliability might be waived.  This is why special situations might be created to work reliably without a 6bed4router.  However, when 6bed4 is built into an application that should "just work", it does need the fallback 6bed4router to be reliable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">The 6bed4 network can reliably switch to direct peering after a successful peering handshake.  This is a deductive approach to NAPT traversal, and is achieved simply by trying direct peering and observing if it arrives.  The lesson taken from prior inductive approaches <a href="#RFC4380" class="xref">[RFC4380]</a> founded on classification of NAPT <a href="#RFC3489" class="xref">[RFC3489]</a> was that such an approach can easily misclassify NAPT behaviour, ensuing in brittle IPv6 connectivity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">The decuction in 6bed4 is mostly through properties of UDP.  Specifically, the absense of a protocol identifier disables interpretation of the protocol behaviour by NAPT, unless bold assumptions are made on the basis of a port number.  To be workable, a NAPT therefore must keep an outward-sending UDP port open for response traffic.  For some protocols, the response may come from other angles, which suggests that Endpoint-Dependent Mapping is not suitable for UDP, but this cannot be assumed in general.  A certain amount of acceptable silence until the given connection closes can however be assumed, and it is commonly suggested that this should be at least 30 seconds.  The only assumption made by 6bed4 is that these 30 seconds are a reasonable default, but of course this MUST be a setting that can be overridden by operators.  NAPT software MUST NOT make any assumptions of passing 6bed4 on the basis of the standard port TBD2 if it is to comply with this specification.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">Given that NAPT can only handle 6bed4peer traffic as generic UDP traffic, any outbound UDP traffic necessarily keeps a hole open for reverse traffic over a reasonable minimum time.  When more traffic is sent before this period has passed, there is no basis for NAPT to assume that the connection can be severed, causing a reset of the timeout for the hole.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">To allow reliable bidirectional traffic between a 6bed4peer and its 6bed4router, it therefore initiates with a Router Solicitation, and then continues to send Keepalive messages with no smaller separating delay than the delay for UDP holes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.3">Keepalive messages need not make it to the 6bed4router to be effective.  Their only need is to make it beyond the last NAPT or firewall.  This can both help to offload a 6bed4router and to avoid that it detects the 6bed4peer still being online; since the 6bed4router is stateless, it has no use for this information.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.4">The content of a Keepalive message can be the minimum that counts as UDP traffic, according to NAPT and firewalls; this is an empty UDP frame.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">When choosing how to forward an IPv6 frame, a 6bed4peer may consider direct routing, but refrain from it on account of reliable considerations.  These are good moments to start working towards direct routing.  Other moments are when a 6bed4peer forces direct peering through the Presumptious and Persistent Peering Policies.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">While working towards direct routing, a few attempts to connect directly are made, by sending a Probe message if no direct traffic is sent at the same time.  Probes are the smallest possible UDP frame, so an empty UDP message.  They differ from Keepalives because their reach is not constrained but the message is sent with the intention of arriving at the remote 6bed4peer.  The destination IPv4 address and UDP port are taken from the bottom half of the destination IPv6 address, which is only permitted for addresses known to be bound by the 6bed4 network.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">When a Probe arrives on a 6bed4peer, it cannot be considered an IPv6 frame.  It is however detected as an incoming UDP frame from a given IPv4 address and UDP port.  This identifies a remote peer that appears to be able to make its way to the UDP socket, all the way through the NAPT and firewalls at the destination end.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">When a Probe arrives at a 6bed4peer, it MUST look if the sending IPv4 address and UDP port have recently received any traffic.  If so, the Probe will be processed into a timer/state product.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">Starting with the time of arrival, a hole can be reliably assumed to be open in local NAPT, and that it remains open for 30 seconds (or a locally overridden timeout) after the last direct send to that remote, even if it was just a Probe or Keepalive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.3">The time for the open hole is subdivided as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>1 second accounts for a message delay in both directions;</li>
<li>27 seconds account for the time that the remote peer may send directly;</li>
<li>the remaining time allows informing the other side that a Probe arrived.</li>
</ul>

<p> when a NAPT hole is assumed to be open for 30 seconds, then this remaining time amounts to 2 seconds.  This time period, added to the time of the last message sent to that remote, indicates a period in which the Seen flag can be sent to the remote.  The remaining time may be negative, in which case the Sent flag is never sent to the remote.  When the local NAPT holes are set to be open for longer periods, then the Seen flag is sent correspondingly longer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.4">The Seen flag can be set in any Traffic Class that adheres to the format for the 6bed4 network.  It does not matter if it is relayed through one or two 6bed4routers, because it informs about the direct connectivity between terminating 6bed4peers, whose IPv4 address and UDP port must occur in the bottom half of addresses if direct peering is to be considered at all.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.5">It is an event when the Seen flag arrives from a 6bed4peer, even from a 6bed4router, when it occurs in a Traffic Class that adheres to the format for the 6bed4 network.  In case of this event, the destination 6bed4peer may conclude that it can use direct peering to the remote 6bed4peer for 27 seconds after arrival of the Seen flag.  In active direct peering connections, the Seen flag is likely to be present on most frames, causing the regular reset of the 27-second timer.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.2">The information kept for each remote peer consists of: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.7.p.6">This undesirable situation blocks further direct peering and requires a fallback to the 6bed4router, whose connection is kept open through Keepalives.  The same approach can only work between 6bed4peers when both send Keepalives to each other, but this may be wasteful in many scenarios, especially when normal traffic flows regularly.  Also note that what worked for setting up direct peering once is likely to work again later.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.8">7.8.</a> <a href="#reliable.adaptive" id="reliable.adaptive">Benefiting from Adaptive Flags</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.8.p.1">The 6bed4 network is concerned with routing and peering policy; this is used by applications, whose logic may be so courteous that it does not matter if a locally bound address changes.  In terms of the Socket API this would be the case when neither bind() nor getsockname() are ever called.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.8.p.2">Such ambivalence to the locally bound address can be a benefit when NAPT mappings alter on a given connection.  It may help the number of direct peering successes to signal that such an address change does not matter to the application logic.  To this end, the Adaptive flag can be set in frames submitted through a 6bed4peer, at the same time as the desired Peering Policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.8.p.3">When this flag is set, the behaviour in case of a mismatched prefix for the remote peer is not to reject the traffic, but instead to substitute the IPv4 address and UDP port in the source IPv6 address of a frame; the /64 prefix should match as always, and the lanid is not altered.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.8.p.4">The address change is not reversed in the destination IPv6 address of reply traffic.  This means that the application would receive the altered address.  If this could otherwise lead to confusion, the application might choose to match reply traffic on the basis of a unique lanid or a random Flow Label.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.8.p.5">It is up to the application if this is possible, and in which frames sent.  The safe default is to not allow Adaptive source IPv6 addresses, but as long as it is usually beneficial to set the Adaptive flag whenever it is of no concern to application logic.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#global" id="global">Global Routing of TBD1::/32</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">TODO: SOLVE A FILTER ON AUTHORITATIVE GATEWAY ROUTERS</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">HINTS FILE OPTION: Distribute the IPv4 addresses of gateway routers as part of the 6bed4router software, as is done for DNS root name servers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">DNS OPTION: Define 32.gateway.6bed4.net to hold /32 gateways, and perhaps &lt;IPv4/16&gt;.48.gateway.6bed4.net to hold /48 gateways.  These gateways are trusted by 6bed4routers.  The only thing these gateways do is to relay native IPv6 prefix TBD1::/32 from/to the 6bed4 network.  The IPv4/UDP is always that of the 6bed4router and the standard UDP port TBD2.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">6TO4 OPTION??? Compare to https://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/6to4-why-is-it-so-bad -- the main problem of 6to4 is firewalls not being setup for it, especially -- https://labs.ripe.net/Members/emileaben/6to4-how-bad-is-it-really -- if it is pushed through without asking users.  Note that a 6bed4peer may also run on a LAN, but only announces an address prefix when Router Solicitation responds.  The 6bed4router should however route properly... which is more easily established when it integrates into a router device where it has access to external interfaces and/or firewall rules.  Given that, even using 2002::/16 instead of TBD1::/32 and routing backend traffic over proto-41 might be an option?  But it has fallen in disgrace, even if only the anycast/unicast mixup of router setups appears to have been a cause and anycast was deprecated for 6to4.  Still, there is the issue of firewall traversal (that we solve by demanding a public IPv4 address and fixed UDP port for 6bed4routers).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> <a href="#iana" id="iana">IANA Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">This specification reserves a 32-bit address prefix TBD1::/32 in the IPv6 address space assigned to the IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry.  The prefix will be exclusively used for 6bed4 addresses, and further assigned as defined in <a href="#_6bed4net.prefix.6bed4" class="xref">Section 3.3.3</a>.  Addresses under this prefix can be used as source and destination addresses, as they are globally routable.  The termination date for the allocation falls ten years after the publication date of this specification in the Request For Comments series; future standardisation work could modify the end date if this is considered useful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">This specification also reserves Port TBD2 from the pools of UDP ports, TCP ports and SCTP ports, subject to possible updates in follow-up specifications.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">The port TBD2 will be the port on which 6bed4routers provide their services.  These servers form a public resource, and remote peers have no mechanism other than the standardised port to know how to contact an arbitrary 6bed4 Server of which only the Fallback IPv4 Address was found in an IPv6 destination address falling under the 6bed4 prefix TBD1::/32.</p>
<p><a id="CREF1" class="info">[CREF1]<span class="info">Rick: Requests to IANA / to be removed after processing: The requested assignment for TBD1 is 2001:64, so TBD1::/32 allocates 2001:64::/32 from 2001::/23 which is suggested (with the 6BONE example) in RFC 2928 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-unicast-address-assignments/ipv6-unicast-address-assignments.xhtml The requested assignment for TBD2 is 25790, which is what we currently use in our code and experimental deployments.  As per RFC 6335, this will probably be assigned under IETF Review or IESG Approval _or_ Expert Review, all defined in RFC 5226.  Note that IETF Review is banned for independent submissions under https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/ and IESG Approval is not a very common procedure.  For Expert Review, it is necessary to document clearly that a Dynamic Port is required; this is the case because clients have no means to infer the port at which to contact a server or a peer.  Especially for peers, whose addresses are inferred from their IPv6 address within the 6bed4 address space, there is no derivation mechanism for these ports; and it is the ability to communicate directly with peers that sets this mechanism apart as extremely scalable and apt for VoIP applications.  </span></a> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.10">
<a href="#rfc.section.10">10.</a> <a href="#security" id="security">Security Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.1">Tunneling mechanisms must always be on their guard for wrapped packets containing false origins <a href="#RFC6169" class="xref">[RFC6169]</a>.  To shield against this, 6bed4 ensures that the source IPv4 address and UDP port of the together match either the Direct or Fallback 6bed4 Address contained in the source IPv6 address.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.2">Note that this facility works best when address filtering <a href="#BCP38" class="xref">[BCP38]</a> is applied.  In lieu of authentication facilities for frame source, the best that the 6bed4 tunnel can do is to avoid worsening the problems of incomplete address filtering.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.3">One exception arises with the possibility that a target 6bed4-Prefixed Address publishes a /32+16 Prefix which is not seen everywhere on the Internet; or that such a prefix is not actually published at all.  In such situations, a 6bed4 Frame may be routed to a TBD1::/32 route, which passes it on to the Fallback 6bed4 Address contained in the IPv6 destination address.  The list of routers that can pass on such traffic will generally be limited, and will be maintained externally to this specification, but documented on 6bed4.net.  Routes announced to larger IP space than owned by the publishing Anonymous System MUST be registered on 6bed4.net so as to distinguish them from abuse.  The domain will publish processible information that helps 6bed4 Servers to recognise this distinction too.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.10.p.4">It is important to realise that 6bed4 bypasses NAT and Firewalls.  This is a feature inasfar as it enables peer-to-peer connectivity, but it also implies a responsibility to not lightly attach services to a 6bed4-Prefixed Address.  There is no protection, other than what is being added.  Specifically noteworthy is that the operator of the 6bed4 Server cannot implement filtering on behalf of their customers; the ability to use Direct 6bed4 Connections would bypass this, and since this could happen at any time such filtering could not even be realiably made connection-aware.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.11">
<a href="#rfc.section.11">11.</a> Acknowledgements</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">This work has evolved from a simple, and perhaps simplistic protocol to its current form.  I owe gratitude to many who contributed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.2">Special thanks go to SURFnet, for generally supporting the idea of 6bed4 and providing long-term support for the first public 6bed4router, as well as supporting the expansion of the initial tunnel investigation work into a generally useful publication <a href="#RFC7059" class="xref">[RFC7059]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">Thanks for financial support in developing phases of the specification and coding of 6bed4 are due towards NLnet Foundation, as well as SURFnet and SIDNfonds.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.4">I owe gratitude to the NLUUG, ISOC NL and RIPE communities for discussing prior tunnel designs and pointing out scaling and routing problems; although the protocol has become more complex it also has become more reliable and, I think, more generally acceptable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.5">Many thanks to Henri Manson for supporting me over a long time in experimental development and many, many tests.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.6">Finally, the work in this tunnel design called for a creative mind set in which technical concepts were highly fluid and changing.  Although it would be difficult to point out a direct link or assign an economic figure, the ability to think in such a mode has clearly been influenced by independent, thought-provoking, boundary-breaking expression by the many artists whose work I have been able to enjoy.  I cherish art in all its forms for its incredible power to help us be imaginative and innovative in the pragmatic field of technology.</p>
