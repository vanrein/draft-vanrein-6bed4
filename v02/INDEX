 * terminology
    * 6bed4 address = (v4addr,udpPort)
    * native address = not-6bed4 address

 * wire format
    * 6bed4 embeds IPv6 into UDP, IPv4
    * representation of 6bed4 addresses: v4addr,udpPort in net order, 6 bytes
    * make use of ND packets for routersol/adv, neighborsol/adv
    * router advertisements are /114 instead of /64 based
    * low half respects EOI by setting local and unicast bits to 0

 * network infrastructure
    * peers (and servers)
    * ask server for public IPv6 address (and keep UDP port open)
    * make no assumptions about NAT/firewalls, except out=ok and timeout>30s
    * connect directly between 6bed4 peers
    * use server to route to native, and as a fallback router for 6bed4
    * use higher-layer techniques to do optimal pairing
    * 10 year limit for NTP-aware devices; extension takes IETF action

 * IPv6 address format
    * prefix claim is for 10 years from now, in lieu of std update
    * prefix is for recognition of 6bed4 addresses
    * prefix is not routed
    * general 6bed4 address is reachable for anyone
    * direct 6bed4 address is at least reachable from the general 6bed4 address
    * direct 6bed4 address may be local if ok by general 6bed4 address
    * general and direct 6bed4 addresses need not be related
    * if not local, direct 6bed4 address may be optimistically tried
    * lanip part is usable for DHCPv6; one UDP port can serve 16382 peers
    * link-local address for network is fe80:: with 1 or 2 levels visible
    * support for multicast addresses is available
    * warn about local addresses (holding a mac part)

 * nat and firewall traversal
    * assume udp-out is okay (new or reused mapping) (possibly remote-param'd)
    * assume udp-reply is mapped back (possibly remote-parameterised)
    * assume no inspection or change of udp contents

 * security measures
    * servers validate on direct 6bed4 address
    * peers validate on general or, if not local, direct 6bed4 address

 * optimistic peering
    * general description
    * default peering: neighbor discovery
    * additional peering: e.g. TCP setup, or SIP/UDP transaction

 * server requirements
    * must validate incoming traffic: first matches actual
    * if incoming messages are invalid, respond routeradv /114, retract wrong
    * answer to routersol from any host, respond routeradv /114
    * possibly reject traffic that does not have one "own" party
    * must repeat nonces and timing for security
    * receive traffic for /48 from native IPv6
    * should forward to /48 if less announced and destination is not me

 * peer requirements
    * must validate incoming traffic: first or second matches actual
    * if incoming messages are invalid, respond routeradv /114, retract wrong
    * answer to routersol from any host, respond routeradv /114
    * if incoming messages are invalid, respond routeradv
    * initiate connections to a 6bed4 peer to their 6bed4 server
    * must inivite peer 6bed4 address for direct access
    * must upon matching accept, send directly to peer for some time
    * must respond to neighborsol with neighboradv from direct peer
    * may respond to other optimistic direct routing
    * must ensure direct contact if peer manages to get in directly
    * must repeat nonces and timing; should send nonces for security
    * keep open connections to all 6bed4 servers in use (portfwd / ttl=3)

 * profiles
    * en-route 6bed4 server profile
       - may hijack default tunnel server address
       - usually under a locally routeable /64 prefix
       - not recognisable as 6bed4 server; ok because no trapeziumshape
    * aggregated 6bed4 server profile
       - has IPv6 BGP announcements to match serviced IPv4 ranges
       - receives IPv6 from native, relays to serviced IPv4 address
    * on-server 6bed4 peer profile
       - makes any server dual-stack
       - requires BGP for /48, or forwarding aggregate, or 6bed4-only service

 * reducing dependency on central server infra
    * local/remote addressing: prefer native--native or else 6bed4--6bed4
    * services that will retry could be rejected when done wrong
    * services that refer to other services should make a clever choice

 * implementation concerns
    * existing neighbor caches may not be designed for high capacity
    * impact list for tunnels

 * iana aspects
    * one /16 prefix for 6bed4 addresses
    * offer public server ipv4 address
